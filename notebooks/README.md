# EDA and Analysis of Solar Radiation Data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo

## Project Description

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar radiation measurement data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The analysis aims to identify key trends and insights to support strategic decisions for solar installations in high-potential regions. The project is part of MoonLight Energy Solutions' initiative to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments.
